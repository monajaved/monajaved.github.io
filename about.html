<p>Hi guys, I am Mona from Mobile, Alabama. I did my Masters in Business Administration from India back in 2017. Since quite sometime I regretted making certain decisions in my academic life.  I started gaining interest in computer programming but thought it's a bit too late for that. I thought I only had two choices, either to go deeper in my field of finance (by studying)  or just keep looking for a job through my existing accomplishments. But after hearing of bootcamps that help you become a software engineer, my whole perception changed. Anyway more about that later. </p>
